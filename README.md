# URAAN-AI-TECHATHON-1.0
AI-powered healthcare tools for Pakistan: chest X-ray diagnosis (TB/pneumonia), OCR-based prescription digitization, and risk scoring for diabetes/heart disease.

This repository contains Phase-1 (1 month) deliverables for an AI-driven healthcare system. It includes three modules: 

(1) CNN-based chest X-ray analysis for TB and pneumonia detection, 

(2) OCR-based digitization and validation of prescriptions in Urdu and English, and 

(3) a risk scoring model for diabetes and heart disease using demographic and health survey data. 

The project addresses Pakistanâ€™s healthcare challenges by enabling early detection, reducing referrals, and supporting public/rural clinics.
